QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: 
Only R2 changes value in the program. The program first use AND to initialize R2 to 0, and then add 12 to R2. So the final value of R2 is 12. 

QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: 
Because step through a program let us find the change of every step, in other words, we can know what the code is doing step by step. Therefore, by compare the output or change of every step with our goal, we can find where the code is not doing as we intend to do and find the bug.
